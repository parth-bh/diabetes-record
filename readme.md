## Diabetes Record App

I have developed an application that makes it easy to track and save your sugar levels. It's much better than using paper because it keeps your records safe. Additionally, it features a login page to organize records for different users and displays all previous diabetes records.

I chose to use Streamlit for this project because it enables rapid app development with built-in styling. This way, I could focus on the application's logic without getting too caught up in styling details.


### Key Features:

1. Effortless Monitoring: Easily record and track blood sugar levels.

2. Data Security: Records are kept safe and private.

3. Historical Insights: Visualize the historical blood sugar data to identify trends and make informed decisions.

5. Streamlined Development: Employed Streamlit for efficient app development.



### Technologies Used:

**Languages Used** : Python, SQL
**Libraries/Frameword Used** : Streamlit, SQLAlchemy

This is the public repository, but I have created it with a new file that is saved in private mode because it contains a database in the folder. I thought it would be a good idea to maintain privacy by keeping it in private mode and deploying it on a server, such as Streamlit. Currently, this app is accessible through the following URL.
